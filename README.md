# Capture the Flag – STM32 Game
Two player real time embedded game developed on the STM3210C-EVAL board using on board TFT screen and ADC-based controls.

## Features
- 2 player real time capture the flag gameplay
- SPI driven TFT display graphics
- ADC based analog joystick / potentiometer input
- Timer and EXTI interrupt based game loop
- Modular and event driven architecture
- Collision detection logic

## Hardware
- STM3210C-EVAL development board
- On board TFT LCD (SPI interface)
- Analog input controls (potentiometer)
- On board timers, ADC, EXTI, and GPIO peripherals

## Software
- C language using STM32 HAL
- SPI graphics rendering engine
- ADC sampling for continuous movement
- Interrupt driven game events and timers
- Lightweight state machine structure

## Notes
Designed as a learning project focusing on embedded graphics, timing, and real-time event handling.
